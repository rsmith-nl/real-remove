Introduction
------------
This is the readme file for version _VERSION of the '_PACKAGE' program,
released on _DATE.

Purpose
-------
This program takes filenames as arguments. It overwrites the contents of
these files with zeros, replaces the filename with a random one and then
unlinks the files.

License
-------
See the LICENSE file.


Building the program
--------------------
For building on FreeBSD and other systems with the GNU toolset, see the
instructions in the file INSTALL. After installation, a manual page for
this program can be read with 'man _PACKAGE'. Additional documentation is
available in _DOCSDIR.

If anyone wants to donate makefiles or project files for other systems and
compilers I will be happy to include them in the distribution.
