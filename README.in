Introduction
------------
This is the readme file for version VERSION of the 'PACKAGE' program,
released on DATE.

Purpose
-------
This program takes filenames as arguments, overwrites them with zeros and
then unlinks them.

License

See the LICENSE file.


Building the program
--------------------
For building on FreeBSD and other systems with the GNU toolset, see the
instructions in the file INSTALL. After installation, a manual page for
this program can be read with 'man PACKAGE'. Additional documentation is
available in DOCDIR.

If anyone wants to donate makefiles or project files for other systems and
compilers I will be happy to include them in the distribution.
